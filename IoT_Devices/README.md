# IoT Devices to Laravel

The current repo contains three implementations of IoT devices, that with http requests sends data to the [backend](https://github.com/University-Thesis-App/Laravel-IoT-Dashboard) of our project.
For the implementations we used different languages and devices to demonstrate the wide range of application. We use an esp32 microcontroller with wire framework , arduino uno with Ethernet shield and wire framework and at last a Raspberry Pi 3 with python3. For the raspberry we used a [Raspberry Pi hat simulation](https://sense-emu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for the simplicity.

# Dependencies
For the programming of the microcontollers we used [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html) plug in on top of VS Code.
